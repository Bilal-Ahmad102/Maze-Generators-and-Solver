# Maze Algorithms in Python

This repository features various maze generation and solving algorithms using Python and Pyglet 1.5.

## Maze Generators

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**
- **Prim's Algorithm**
- **Aldous-Broder Algorithm**

## Maze Solvers

- **A* (A Star) Algorithm**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Right Hand Rule**

### Installation

To run these algorithms, you need to have Python and Pyglet version 1.5 installed. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bilal-Ahmad102/Maze-Generators-and-Solver
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Pyglet version 1.5:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyglet==1.5
   ```

4. **Run the algorithms:**
   Navigate to the desired algorithm folder and run the corresponding script:
   ```bash
   python grid.py
   ```
